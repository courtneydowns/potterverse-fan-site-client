## Overview

Welcome to Potterverse!<br/>

The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive site for Harry Potter fans.<br/>

Potterverse gives fans the ability to search categories (Characters, Magical Objects, Potion Ingredients, Potions, Spells, Wand Cores and Wand Woods). The can leave comments on each entry, as well as update and delete them. Users can sign up or login to gain access to the site and will NOT be able to see any of the content of the site unless they are logged in or signed up.

## Code Example

Here is an example of the code:

```js
{
  localStorage.getItem("isAdmin") === "true" ||
  comment.userId == localStorage.getItem("userId") ? (
    <AiOutlineClose
      className="close-icon"
      onClick={() => this.commentDelete(comment.id)}
    />
  ) : null;
}
```

In the Characters.jsx file, this block of code is saying that if the local storage has a value of "true for the Admin or if the userId of the comment matches the userId in storage, then either one can delete a comment (it has to be the user's own comment), otherwise a user that does not own the comment can not delete it.
